* [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) - A tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.
* [Kali](http://www.kali.org/) - Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. Kali Linux is preinstalled with numerous penetration-testing programs, including nmap (a port scanner), Wireshark (a packet analyzer), John the Ripper (a password cracker), and Aircrack-ng (a software suite for penetration-testing wireless LANs).

### Monitoring / Logging

* [justniffer](http://justniffer.sourceforge.net/) - Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all "intercepted" files from the HTTP traffic.
* [httpry](http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/) - httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.
* [ngrep](http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/) - ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
* [passivedns](https://github.com/gamelinux/passivedns) - A tool to collect DNS records passively to aid Incident handling, Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and general digital forensics. PassiveDNS sniffes traffic from an interface or reads a pcap-file and outputs
the DNS-server answers to a log file. PassiveDNS can cache/aggregate duplicate
DNS answers in-memory, limiting the amount of data in the logfile without
loosing the essens in the DNS answer.
* [sagan](http://sagan.quadrantsec.com/) - Sagan uses a 'Snort like' engine and rules to analyze logs (syslog/event log/snmptrap/netflow/etc).
* [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net/) -  OSSEC is an Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System that performs log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting and active response. It runs on most operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows. 
* [ntopng](http://www.ntop.org/products/ntop/) - Ntopng is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does.

### IDS / IPS / Host IDS / Host IPS

Snort is now developed by Sourcefire, of which Roesch is the founder and CTO. In 2009, Snort entered InfoWorld's Open Source Hall of Fame as one of the "greatest [pieces of] open source software of all time".
* [Bro](https://www.bro.org/) - Bro is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know.
* [Suricata](http://suricata-ids.org/) - Suricata is a high performance Network IDS, IPS and Network Security Monitoring engine. Open Source and owned by a community run non-profit foundation, the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). Suricata is developed by the OISF and its supporting vendors. 
* [Security Onion](http://blog.securityonion.net/) - Security Onion is a Linux distro for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management. It's based on Ubuntu and contains Snort, Suricata, Bro, OSSEC, Sguil, Squert, Snorby, ELSA, Xplico, NetworkMiner, and many other security tools. The easy-to-use Setup wizard allows you to build an army of distributed sensors for your enterprise in minutes!
* [sshwatch](https://github.com/marshyski/sshwatch) - IPS for SSH similar to DenyHosts written in Python.  It also can gather information about attacker during the attack in a log.

### Honey Pot / Honey Net

* [Dionaea](http://dionaea.carnivore.it/) - Dionaea is meant to be a nepenthes successor, embedding python as scripting language, using libemu to detect shellcodes, supporting ipv6 and tls.
* [Conpot](http://conpot.org/) - ICS/SCADA Honeypot. Conpot is a low interactive server side Industrial Control Systems honeypot designed to be easy to deploy, modify and extend. By providing a range of common industrial control protocols we created the basics to build your own system, capable to emulate complex infrastructures to convince an adversary that he just found a huge industrial complex. To improve the deceptive capabilities, we also provided the possibility to server a custom human machine interface to increase the honeypots attack surface. The response times of the services can be artificially delayed to mimic the behaviour of a system under constant load. Because we are providing complete stacks of the protocols, Conpot can be accessed with productive HMI's or extended with real hardware. Conpot is developed under the umbrella of the Honeynet Project and on the shoulders of a couple of very big giants.
* [Amun](https://github.com/zeroq/amun) - Amun Python-based low-interaction Honeypot.

* [Bifrozt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bifrozt/) - Bifrozt is a NAT device with a DHCP server that is usually deployed with one NIC connected directly to the Internet and one NIC connected to the internal network. What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard NAT devices is its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy between an attacker and your honeypot. If you deployed a SSH server on Bifroztâ€™s internal network it would log all the interaction to a TTY file in plain text that could be viewed later and capture a copy of any files that were downloaded. You would not have to install any additional software, compile any kernel modules or use a specific version or type of operating system on the internal SSH server for this to work. It will limit outbound traffic to a set number of ports and will start to drop outbound packets on these ports when certain limits are exceeded.
* [HoneyDrive](http://bruteforce.gr/honeydrive) - HoneyDrive is the premier honeypot Linux distro. It is a virtual appliance (OVA) with Xubuntu Desktop 12.04.4 LTS edition installed.

Additionally it includes many useful pre-configured scripts and utilities to analyze, visualize and process the data it can capture, such as Kippo-Graph, Honeyd-Viz, DionaeaFR, an ELK stack and much more. Lastly, almost 90 well-known malware analysis, forensics and network monitoring related tools are also present in the distribution.

* [Xplico](http://www.xplico.org/) - The goal of Xplico is extract from an internet traffic capture the applications data contained. For example, from a pcap file Xplico extracts each email (POP, IMAP, and SMTP protocols), all HTTP contents, each VoIP call (SIP), FTP, TFTP, and so on. Xplico isnâ€™t a network protocol analyzer. Xplico is an open source Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT).
* [Moloch](http://github.com/aol/moloch) - Moloch is an open source, large scale IPv4 packet capturing (PCAP), indexing and database system. A simple web interface is provided for PCAP browsing, searching, and exporting. APIs are exposed that allow PCAP data and JSON-formatted session data to be downloaded directly. Simple security is implemented by using HTTPS and HTTP digest password support or by using apache in front. Moloch is not meant to replace IDS engines but instead work along side them to store and index all the network traffic in standard PCAP format, providing fast access. Moloch is built to be deployed across many systems and can scale to handle multiple gigabits/sec of traffic.

Wireshark is very similar to tcpdump, but has a graphical front-end, plus some integrated sorting and filtering options.
* [netsniff-ng](http://netsniff-ng.org/) -  netsniff-ng is a free Linux networking toolkit, a Swiss army knife for your daily Linux network plumbing if you will. Its gain of performance is reached by zero-copy mechanisms, so that on packet reception and transmission the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel space to user space and vice versa.
