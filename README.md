- [Nmap](https://nmap.org) - Nmap is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.
- [Amass](https://github.com/caffix/amass) - Amass performs DNS subdomain enumeration by scraping the largest number of disparate data sources, recursive brute forcing, crawling of web archives, permuting and altering names, reverse DNS sweeping and other techniques.

### Monitoring / Logging

- [justniffer](http://justniffer.sourceforge.net/) - Justniffer is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic and produces logs in a customized way, can emulate Apache web server log files, track response times and extract all "intercepted" files from the HTTP traffic.
- [httpry](http://dumpsterventures.com/jason/httpry/) - httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself, but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different applications.
- [ngrep](http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/) - ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
- [passivedns](https://github.com/gamelinux/passivedns) - A tool to collect DNS records passively to aid Incident handling, Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and general digital forensics. PassiveDNS sniffs traffic from an interface or reads a pcap-file and outputs the DNS-server answers to a log file. PassiveDNS can cache/aggregate duplicate DNS answers in-memory, limiting the amount of data in the logfile without loosing the essens in the DNS answer.
- [sagan](http://sagan.quadrantsec.com/) - Sagan uses a 'Snort like' engine and rules to analyze logs (syslog/event log/snmptrap/netflow/etc).

Fibratus has a very simple CLI which encapsulates the machinery to start the kernel event stream collector, set kernel event filters or run the lightweight Python modules called filaments.

### IDS / IPS / Host IDS / Host IPS

- [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) - Snort is a free and open source network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) and network intrusion detection system (NIDS)created by Martin Roesch in 1998. Snort is now developed by Sourcefire, of which Roesch is the founder and CTO. In 2009, Snort entered InfoWorld's Open Source Hall of Fame as one of the "greatest [pieces of] open source software of all time".
- [Bro](https://www.bro.org/) - Bro is a powerful network analysis framework that is much different from the typical IDS you may know.
- [OSSEC](https://ossec.github.io/) - Comprehensive Open Source HIDS. Not for the faint of heart. Takes a bit to get your head around how it works. Performs log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting and active response. It runs on most operating systems, including Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows. Plenty of reasonable documentation. Sweet spot is medium to large deployments.
- [Suricata](http://suricata-ids.org/) - Suricata is a high performance Network IDS, IPS and Network Security Monitoring engine.

Highly recommended for small to medium deployments.
- [AIEngine](https://bitbucket.org/camp0/aiengine) - AIEngine is a next generation interactive/programmable Python/Ruby/Java/Lua packet inspection engine with capabilities of learning without any human intervention, NIDS(Network Intrusion Detection System) functionality, DNS domain classification, network collector, network forensics and many others.

- [Dionaea](https://www.edgis-security.org/honeypot/dionaea/) - Dionaea is meant to be a nepenthes successor, embedding python as scripting language, using libemu to detect shellcodes, supporting ipv6 and tls.
- [Conpot](http://conpot.org/) - ICS/SCADA Honeypot. Conpot is a low interactive server side Industrial Control Systems honeypot designed to be easy to deploy, modify and extend. By providing a range of common industrial control protocols we created the basics to build your own system, capable to emulate complex infrastructures to convince an adversary that he just found a huge industrial complex. To improve the deceptive capabilities, we also provided the possibility to server a custom human machine interface to increase the honeypots attack surface. The response times of the services can be artificially delayed to mimic the behaviour of a system under constant load. Because we are providing complete stacks of the protocols, Conpot can be accessed with productive HMI's or extended with real hardware. Conpot is developed under the umbrella of the Honeynet Project and on the shoulders of a couple of very big giants.
- [Amun](https://github.com/zeroq/amun) - Amun Python-based low-interaction Honeypot.
- [Glastopf](http://glastopf.org/) - Glastopf is a Honeypot which emulates thousands of vulnerabilities to gather data from attacks targeting web applications. The principle behind it is very simple: Reply the correct response to the attacker exploiting the web application.

- [Bifrozt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bifrozt/) - Bifrozt is a NAT device with a DHCP server that is usually deployed with one NIC connected directly to the Internet and one NIC connected to the internal network. What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard NAT devices is its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy between an attacker and your honeypot. If you deployed an SSH server on Bifrozt’s internal network it would log all the interaction to a TTY file in plain text that could be viewed later and capture a copy of any files that were downloaded. You would not have to install any additional software, compile any kernel modules or use a specific version or type of operating system on the internal SSH server for this to work. It will limit outbound traffic to a set number of ports and will start to drop outbound packets on these ports when certain limits are exceeded.
- [HoneyDrive](http://bruteforce.gr/honeydrive) - HoneyDrive is the premier honeypot Linux distro. It is a virtual appliance (OVA) with Xubuntu Desktop 12.04.4 LTS edition installed.

Additionally it includes many useful pre-configured scripts and utilities to analyze, visualize and process the data it can capture, such as Kippo-Graph, Honeyd-Viz, DionaeaFR, an ELK stack and much more. Lastly, almost 90 well-known malware analysis, forensics and network monitoring related tools are also present in the distribution.
- [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/) - Cuckoo Sandbox is an Open Source software for automating analysis of suspicious files. To do so it makes use of custom components that monitor the behavior of the malicious processes while running in an isolated environment.
- [T-Pot Honeypot Distro](http://dtag-dev-sec.github.io/mediator/feature/2017/11/07/t-pot-17.10.html) - T-Pot is based on the network installer of Ubuntu Server 16/17.x LTS. The honeypot daemons as well as other support components being used have been containerized using docker. This allows us to run multiple honeypot daemons on the same network interface while maintaining a small footprint and constrain each honeypot within its own environment. Installation over vanilla Ubuntu - [T-Pot Autoinstall](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall) - This script will install T-Pot 16.04/17.10 on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04.x LTS (64bit).

Its gain of performance is reached by zero-copy mechanisms, so that on packet reception and transmission the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel space to user space and vice versa.
- [Live HTTP headers](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/live-http-headers/) - Live HTTP headers is a free firefox addon to see your browser requests in real time. It shows the entire headers of the requests and can be used to find the security loopholes in implementations.
